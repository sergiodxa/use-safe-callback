# useSafeCallback ![CI](https://github.com/sergiodxa/use-safe-callback/workflows/CI/badge.svg) ![Publish](https://github.com/sergiodxa/use-safe-callback/workflows/Publish/badge.svg)

Wrap a function to ensure you never call it if a component is unmounted, useful to avoid cases where an async code could finish after a component has unmounted and it tries to update a state.

## Usage

Install it

```sh
$ yarn add use-safe-callback
```

Import it

```ts
import useSafeCallback from "use-safe-callback"
```

Wrap your unsafe callback

```ts
const [state, unsafeDispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);
const safeDispatch = useSafeCallback(unsafeDispatch);
```

Use it as your unsafe callback

```ts
safeDispatch({ type: "MY_ACTION" })
```

Your unsafe callback will not run if the component is unmounted, preventing you to trying to update the state.
